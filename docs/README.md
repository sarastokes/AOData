# Documentation 

AOData's formal PDF documentation is currently outdated as the emphasis on documentation has shifted to into the MATLAB code (accessible with `help` or `doc`). 

The code  PDF documentation contains a useful introduction to the motivation and decisions behind AOData. The main goal of the PDF documentation is to explain the design decisions and inner workings of AOData that are not covered in the in-code documentation or tutorials. These aspects are not essential for AOData's use but may become useful for advanced development or to answer specific questions about how/why certain features work.
